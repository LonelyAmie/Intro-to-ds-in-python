# `.apply()`
- ==use when working with rows==
- applies a UDF (user defined function) to either rows or columns of a DataFrame
## How To Use 
- the UDF works with [[Pandas Series]]. that mean's you are using series' syntax in UDF
> Every single row of a DataFrame is a series object indexed by column names
```python
def ud_func(x) :
	return x
df.apply(x, axis = 1)
```
- axis = 0 : axis along indexes which means __columns__
- axis = 1 : axis along columns which means __rows__
## Some Tips 
1. ~~Mutating a container *while* iterating over it~~ -> Using a copy of container
```python
def ud_func (x) : 
	x = x.copy()
	return x
```
2. Works faster when applied to rows -> applying to ~~columns~~ *Transposed rows*

# `Series.str.extract()` 
- ==use when working with columns==
- gets regex as input and returns the grouped matches
	```python
	pattern = r'^(\d{1,2}) years old'
	df['Age'] = df['Age'].str.extract(pattern)
	```
- works on a Series (which means a single column or a single row) 
- working on multiple series => `.apply()` + `str.extract()`
- group names --> column names
	```python
	named_pattern = r'(?P<name>pattern)'
	```
